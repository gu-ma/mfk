# MfK Dance Diffusion

## Info

Installation for MfK dance exhibition. 

1. Objective: Create an interactive installation that uses a beamer, a sensor, and a PC to track the movements of visitors and generate real-time AI-generated images with low latency. Specifics of the AI scenarios are yet to be defined.
2. Audience: Designed for multiple people and families (total number tbd).
3. Usability and Maintenance: The installation should be easy for staff to activate and deactivate and should operate smoothly with minimal maintenance. Includes a guide for basic operations and troubleshooting and support during the exhibition in case of malfunctions.
4. Duration: The installation must operate throughout the DANCE exhibition.
5. Flexibility: It should be possible to change the scenarios or prompts based on time of day, hour, or even through visitor interactions (perhaps through gestures, still tbd).
6. Sound: The sound component should include one or more tracks pre-installed on Tonwelt audioguides, synced with a timecode.
7. Timeline: The installation must be ready for installation by early to mid-August, with testing scheduled for September.
